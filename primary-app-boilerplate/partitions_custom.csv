## NOTE: Apps size must be divisible by 64. Total Size: 4060k

## Our objective here is to create an app that's no
## larger than 1408K and uses OTA. This app will later
## but put on a unit that has a factory app which will
## load this app via an OTA web interface onto an OTA
## partition that's 1408K.
